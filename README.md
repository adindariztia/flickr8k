# Image-Captioning

This repository is an adaptation of code initially uploaded at [Original Repo](https://github.com/euler16/Image-Captioning-TensorFlowjs) by the respective account. We have made adjustments such as modifying the HTML using Bootstrap, changing the pre-trained model to our custom model, and employing Inception V3 for feature extraction.

This project is a submission for the Bangk!t final group assignment on CNN TensorFlow models.

## Project Overview
The image captioning project is a machine learning-embedded web application that accepts your images and generates captions from them. Using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model like Inception V3 for feature extraction and a custom model for generating captions, this application combines computer vision and natural language processing to describe the contents of images in natural language.

## How to Run
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Captioning.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd Image-Captioning
3. Start a local server.
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.
